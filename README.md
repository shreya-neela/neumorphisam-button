What is Neumorphism?
It is a revitalization of the trend, Skeuomorphism created by Steve Jobs. It is essentially the idea that this design would mock 3D and real world elements with the hopes of creating a more realistic experience for the user. The style utilizes a multitude of shadows (soft & harsh), objects, and shapes.
Neumorphism or Soft UI is a combination of flat design and skeuomorphism. By adding intense drop/box shadows to elements, it creates an effect that the element is able to be pushed or interacted with.
 
How to Create Neumorphic Elements Using HTML & CSS
Download a text editor to play around with your code. I recommend using Brackets or Sublime Text which are both source code editors.
Once you have downloaded your preferred text editor, create two documents. One will be your HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and the second will be dedicated to your CSS (styling). Make sure to save both to a specified folder on your Desktop.
